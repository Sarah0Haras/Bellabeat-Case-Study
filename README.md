### Checking number of users
```sql
SELECT  
COUNT(DISTINCT(`portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity`.id) )AS Total_Daily_Activity_ID,
COUNT(DISTINCT(`portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailySleep`.id) ) AS Total_Sleep_ID,
COUNT(DISTINCT(`portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.hourlySteps`.id) ) AS Total_Steps_ID

FROM `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity` 

FULL OUTER JOIN `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailySleep` ON `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity`.ID = `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailySleep`.ID
AND  `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity`.ActivityDate = `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailySleep`.SleepDay

FULL OUTER JOIN `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.hourlySteps` ON `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailySleep`.ID = `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.hourlySteps`.ID
AND  `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailySleep`.SleepDay = `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.hourlySteps`.ActivityDate

### Checking Duplicates

#### dailyActivity Table
```sql
SELECT  
`portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity`.Id AS ID , 
COUNT(`portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity`.Id) AS Total_Act_Day, 
COUNT(DISTINCT(`portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity`.ActivityDate)) AS Total_Act_Day_DIST

FROM `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity` 
GROUP By `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity`.Id
HAVING Total_Act_Day != Total_Act_Day_DIST
```
No duplicate found

#### dailySleep Table
```sql

#### hourlySteps Table
```sql
SELECT ID,
COUNT(DISTINCT(ActivityDate)) AS Total_Act_Day,
COUNT(DISTINCT(ActivityHour)) AS Total_Hr_A_Day
FROM `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.hourlySteps`

## Analyze Phase

This analysis is to find trends and determine if they can help us on Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
According to [this article](https://www.10000steps.org.au/articles/healthy-lifestyles/counting-steps/), the daily amount of step and activity levels can be classified as below:
* Sedentary - less than 5,000 steps per day 
* Low active - 5,000 to 7,499 steps per day
* Somewhat active - 7,500 to 9,999 steps per day
* Active - more than 10,000 steps per day

Finding the users average of daily steps, daily calories and daily sleep in minutes
```sql
SELECT  
ID, AVG(TotalSteps) AS Avg_Daily_Steps,AVG(Calories) AS Avg_Daily_Calories,
FROM `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity` 
GROUP BY Id
```
```sql
SELECT ID, AVG(TotalMinutesAsleep) AS Avg_Daily_Sleep_MM
FROM `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailySleep` 
GROUP BY Id
```
Classify activity levels by daily average steps

```sql
SELECT  
ID, AVG(TotalSteps) AS Avg_Daily_Steps,AVG(Calories) AS Avg_Daily_Calories,
CASE
 WHEN AVG(TotalSteps) <5000 THEN 'Sedentary'
 WHEN AVG(TotalSteps) >=5000 AND AVG(TotalSteps) <7499 THEN 'Low active'
 WHEN AVG(TotalSteps) >=7500 AND AVG(TotalSteps) <9999 THEN 'Somewhat active'
 WHEN AVG(TotalSteps) >10000 THEN 'Active'
END AS Active_Lvl
FROM `portfolio-363100.Bellabeat_Case_Study.dailyActivity` 
GROUP BY Id
```
Create a temporary table to count the percentage of each Active Level.
